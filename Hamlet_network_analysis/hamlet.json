        "SCENE I.--ELSINORE. A PLATFORM BEFORE THE CASTLE. NIGHT.": "FRANCISCO _on his post. Enter to him_ BERNARDO (L.H.) Bernardo Who's there? Francisco (R.) Nay, answer me:[1] stand, and unfold[2] yourself. Bernardo Long live the king![3] Francisco Bernardo? Bernardo He. Francisco You come most carefully upon your hour. Bernardo 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco. Francisco For this relief much thanks: [_Crosses to_ L.] 'tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart. Bernardo Have you had quiet guard? Francisco Not a mouse stirring. Bernardo Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch,[4] bid them make haste. Francisco I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who's there? Horatio Friends to this ground. Marcellus And liegemen to the Dane.[5] _Enter_ HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS (L.H.) Francisco Give you good night. Marcellus O, farewell, honest soldier: Who hath reliev'd you? Francisco Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. [_Exit_ FRANCISCO, L.H.] Marcellus Holloa! Bernardo! Bernardo Say, What, is Horatio there? Horatio (_Crosses to_ C.) A piece of him.[6] Bernardo (R.) Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus. Horatio What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? Bernardo I have seen nothing. Marcellus (L.) Horatio says, 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him, Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us: Therefore I have entreated him, along With us, to watch the minutes of this night;[7] That, if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes,[8] and speak to it. Horatio Tush! tush! 'twill not appear. Bernardo Come, let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.[9] Horatio Well, let us hear Bernardo speak of this. Bernardo Last night of all, When yon same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus, and myself, The bell then beating one-- Marcellus Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again! _Enter_ Ghost (L.H.) Bernardo In the same figure, like the king that's dead. Horatio Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.[10] Bernardo It would be spoke to. Marcellus Speak to it, Horatio. Horatio What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,[11] Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak! Marcellus It is offended. [Ghost _crosses to_ R.] Bernardo See! it stalks away! Horatio Stay!--speak!--speak, I charge thee, speak! [_Exit_ Ghost, R.H.] Marcellus 'Tis gone, and will not answer. Bernardo How now, Horatio! You tremble, and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you of it? Horatio Before heaven, I might not this believe, Without the sensible and true avouch[12] Of mine own eyes. Marcellus Is it not like the king? Horatio As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on, When he the ambitious Norway combated. Marcellus Thus, twice before, and jump at this dead hour,[13] With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. Horatio In what particular thought to work,[14] I know not; But in the gross and scope[15] of mine opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.[16] In the most high and palmy[17] state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets. _Re-enter_ Ghost (R.H.) But, (L.C.) soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blast me. [HORATIO _crosses in front of the_ Ghost _to_ R. Ghost _crosses to_ L.] Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,[18] Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and grace to me, Speak to me: If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! O, if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,[19] For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it:--stay, and speak! [_Exit_ Ghost, L.H.] Marcellus 'Tis gone! We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence. Bernardo It was about to speak, when the cock crew. Horatio And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons.[20] I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet of the morn, Doth with his lofty[21] and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit[22] hies To his confine. But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill: Break we our watch up; and, by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. [_Exeunt_, L.H.]",
        "SCENE II.--A ROOM OF STATE IN THE PALACE.": "_Trumpet March._ _Enter the_ KING _and_ QUEEN, _preceded by_ POLONIUS, HAMLET, LAERTES,[23] Lords, Ladies, _and_ Attendants. King (R.C.) Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green;[24] and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe; Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature, That we with wisest sorrow[25] think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress of this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,[26] Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd[27] Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along:--For all, our thanks. And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit; What is't, Laertes? Laertes (R.) My dread lord, Your leave and favour[28] to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France, And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. King Have you your father's leave? What says Polonious? Polonius (R.) He hath, my lord, (wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition; and, at last, Upon his will I sealed my hard consent):[29] I do beseech you, give him leave to go. King Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will![30] But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,---- Hamlet (L.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.[31] [Aside.] King How is it that the clouds still hang on you? Hamlet Not so, my lord; I am too much i'the sun.[32] Queen(L.C.) Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour[33] off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids[34] Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know'st 'tis common, all that live must die, Passing through nature to eternity. Hamlet Ay, madam, it is common. Queen If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee? Hamlet Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not seems. 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor the dejected haviour of the visage, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief, That can denote me truly: These, indeed, seem, For they are actions that a man might play. But I have that within which passeth show;[35] These but the trappings[36] and the suits of woe. King 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his;[37] and the survivor bound, In filial obligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow:[38] But to pers\u00e9ver[39] In obstinate condolement,[40] is a course Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief: It shows a will most incorrect to Heaven.[41] We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing[42] woe; and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. Queen Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg. Hamlet I shall in all my best obey you, madam. King Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply; Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come; This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart:[43] in grace whereof,[44] No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,[45] But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell; Re-speaking earthly thunder. [_Trumpet March repeated. Exeunt_ KING _and_ QUEEN, _preceded by_ POLONIUS, Lords, Ladies, LAERTES, _and_ Attendants, R.H.] Hamlet O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself[46] into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon[47] 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world![48] Fye on't! O fye! 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely.[49] That it should come to this! But two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr:[50] so loving to my mother, That he might not beteem[51] the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: And yet, within a month,-- Let me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is Woman!-- A little month; or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears;--she married with my uncle, My father's brother; but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. It is not, nor it cannot come to, good: But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue! _Enter_ HORATIO, BERNARDO, _and_ MARCELLUS (R.H.) Horatio Hail to your lordship! Hamlet I am glad to see you well: Horatio,--or I do forget myself. Horatio The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. Hamlet Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:[52] And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?-- Marcellus? [_Crosses to_ C.] Marcellus (R.) My good lord, Hamlet (C.) I am very glad to see you; good even, sir. [_To_ BERNARDO, R.] But what, in faith,[53] make you[54] from Wittenberg?[55] Horatio (L.) A truant disposition, good my lord. Hamlet I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself: I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep, ere you depart. Horatio My lord, I came to see your father's funeral. Hamlet I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; I think it was to see my mother's wedding. Horatio Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. Hamlet Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral bak'd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe[56] in Heaven Ere ever I had seen that day, Horatio! My father,--Methinks, I see my father. Horatio Where, My lord? Hamlet In my mind's eye, Horatio. Horatio I saw him once; he was a goodly king.[57] Hamlet He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again. [_Crosses to_ L.] Horatio (C.) My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. Hamlet Saw who? Horatio My lord, the king your father. Hamlet The king my father! Horatio Season your admiration for a while[58] With an attent ear; till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you. Hamlet For Heaven's love, let me hear. Horatio Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night,[59] Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father, Arm'd at all points exactly, cap-\u00e0-p\u00e9, Appears before them, and, with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surpris\u00e8d eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd Almost to jelly with the act of fear,[60] Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did; And I with them the third night kept the watch: Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. Hamlet But where was this? [_Crosses to_ MARCELLUS.] Marcellus (R.) My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. Hamlet (C.) Did you not speak to it? Horatio (L.) My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up its head, and did address[61] Itself to motion, like as it would speak: But, even then, the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away; And vanish'd from our sight. Hamlet 'Tis very strange. Horatio As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down[62] in our duty To let you know of it. Hamlet Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? Marcellus We do, my lord. Hamlet Arm'd, say you? Marcellus Arm'd, my lord. Hamlet From top to toe? Marcellus My lord, from head to foot. Hamlet Then saw you not His face? Horatio O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.[63] Hamlet What, looked he frowningly? Horatio A countenance more In sorrow than in anger. Hamlet Pale or red? Horatio Nay, very pale. Hamlet And fix'd his eyes upon you? Horatio Most constantly. Hamlet I would I had been there. Horatio It would have much amaz'd you. Hamlet Very like, Very like. Stay'd it long? Horatio While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. Marcellus} } Longer, Longer. Bernardo} Horatio Not when I saw it. Hamlet His beard was grizzl'd, No? Horatio It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd. Hamlet I will watch to-night; Perchance, 'twill walk again. Horatio (C.) I warrant it will. Hamlet If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape, And bid me hold my peace. [_Crosses to_ L.] I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable[64] in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue; I will requite your loves. So, fare you well: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you. Horatio (R.) Our duty to your honour. Hamlet Your loves, as mine to you: Farewell. [_Exeunt_ HORATIO, MARCELLUS, _and_ BERNARDO, R.H.] My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; I doubt some foul play: 'would the night were come; Till then sit still, my soul: Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. [_Exit_, L.H.]",
        "SCENE III.--A ROOM IN POLONIUS'S HOUSE.": "_Enter_ LAERTES _and_ OPHELIA (R.H.) Laertes (L.C.) My necessaries are embarked: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit,[65] Let me hear from you. Ophelia (R.C.) Do you doubt that? Laertes For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,[66] Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The p\u00e9rfume and suppliance of a minute.[67] Ophelia No more but so? Laertes He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and the health of the whole state. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister; And keep within the rear of your affection,[68] Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid[69] is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes: Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. Ophelia I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,[70] Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own read.[71] Laertes O, fear me not. I stay too long;--but here my father comes. _Enter_ POLONIUS (L.H.) Polonius Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,[72] And you are staid for. There,--my blessing with you! [_Laying his hand on_ LAERTES' _head_.] And these few precepts in thy memory-- Look thou char\u00e1cter.[73] Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought[74] his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice: Take each man's censure,[75] but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that.[76] Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself and friend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.[77] This above all,--To thine ownself be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell; my blessing season this in thee![78] Laertes Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. [_Crosses to_ L.] Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What I have said to you. Ophelia (_Crosses to_ LAERTES.) 'Tis in my memory lock'd, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.[79] Laertes Farewell. [_Exit_ LAERTES, L.H.] Polonius What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you? Ophelia So please you, something touching the lord Hamlet. Polonius Marry, well bethought: 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you;[80] and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: If it be so (as so 'tis put on me,[81] And that in way of caution), I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter, and your honour. What is between[82] you? give me up the truth. Ophelia He hath, my lord, of late, made many tenders Of his affection to me. Polonius Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted[83] in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? Ophelia I do not know, my lord, what I should think. Polonius Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby; That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or, you'll tender me a fool. Ophelia My lord, he hath imp\u00f3rtun'd me with love In honourable fashion. Polonius Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to. Ophelia And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven. Polonius Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.[84] I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: This is for all,-- I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any leisure moment,[85] As to give words or talk with the lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you: come your ways. Ophelia I shall obey, my lord. [_Exeunt_, R.H.]",
        "SCENE IV.--THE PLATFORM. NIGHT.": "_Enter_ HAMLET, HORATIO, _and_ MARCELLUS (L.H.U.E.) Hamlet The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. Horatio It is a nipping and an eager air.[86] Hamlet What hour now? Horatio I think it lacks of twelve. Marcellus No, it is struck. Horatio (R.C.) Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season, Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. [_A Flourish of Trumpets, and Ordnance shot off without._] What does this mean, my lord? Hamlet (L.C.) The king doth wake to-night,[87] and takes his rouse,[88] And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge. Horatio Is it a custom? Hamlet Ay, marry, is't: [_Crosses to_ HORATIO.] But to my mind,--though I am native here, And to the manner born,--it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. _Enter_ Ghost (L.H.) Horatio (R.H.) Look, my lord, it comes! Hamlet (C.) Angels and ministers of grace defend us!-- Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,[89] That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee--Hamlet, King, father: Royal Dane: O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,[90] Have burst their cerements;[91] why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again! What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again, in c\u00f3mplete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature[92] So horridly to shake our disposition[93] With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? [Ghost _beckons._] Horatio It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone. [Ghost _beckons again._] Marcellus Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more remov\u00e8d ground:[94] But do not go with it. Horatio No, by no means. Hamlet It will not speak; then I will follow it. Horatio Do not, my lord. Hamlet Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee;[95] And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? [Ghost _beckons._] It waves me forth again;--I'll follow it. Horatio What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,[96] Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea,[97] And there assume some other horrible form, And draw you into madness? [Ghost _beckons._] Hamlet It waves me still.-- Go on; I'll follow thee. Marcellus You shall not go, my lord. Hamlet Hold off your hands. Horatio Be rul'd; you shall not go. Hamlet My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the N\u00e9mean lion's nerve.[98] [Ghost _beckons_] Still am I call'd:--unhand me, gentlemen; [_Breaking from them._] By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me:--[99] I say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee. [_Exeunt_ Ghost _and_ HAMLET, L.H., _followed at a distance by_ HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS.]",
        "SCENE V.--A MORE REMOTE PART OF THE PLATFORM. NIGHT.": "_Re-enter_ Ghost _and_ HAMLET (L.H.U.E.) Hamlet (R.) Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak; I'll go no further. Ghost (L.) Mark me. Hamlet I will. Ghost My hour is almost come, When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself. Hamlet Alas, poor ghost! Ghost Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold. Hamlet Speak; I am bound to hear. Ghost So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. Hamlet What? Ghost I am thy father's spirit; Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,[100] Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul;[101] freeze thy young blood; Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres; Thy knotted and combin\u00e8d locks to part, And each particular hair to stand on end,[102] Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:[103] But this eternal blazon[104] must not be To ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!-- If thou didst ever thy dear father love,---- Hamlet O Heaven! Ghost Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. Hamlet Murder! Ghost Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. Hamlet Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge. Ghost I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,[105] Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: 'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,[106] A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process[107] of my death Rankly abus'd: but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown. Hamlet O, my prophetic soul! my uncle! Ghost Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, Won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming virtuous queen: O, Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity, That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage; and to decline Upon a wretch,[108] whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be.--Sleeping within mine orchard, My custom always in the afternoon, Upon my secure[109] hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon[110] in a vial, And in the porches of mine ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man, That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body; So did it mine; Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once despatch'd:[111] Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;[112] No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head. Hamlet O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! Ghost If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury[113] and damn\u00e8d incest. But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his ineffectual fire:[114] Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember me. [_Exit_, L.H.] Hamlet Hold, hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.[115] Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all forms, all pressures past,[116] And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven, I have sworn't. Horatio (_Without._) My lord, my lord,---- Marcellus (_Without._) Lord Hamlet,---- Horatio (_Without._) Heaven secure him! Hamlet So be it! Marcellus (_Without._) Illo, ho, ho, my lord! Hamlet Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.[117] _Enter_ HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS (L.H.U.E.) Marcellus (R.) How is't, my noble lord? Horatio (L.) What news, my lord? Hamlet (C.) O, wonderful! Horatio Good my lord, tell it. Hamlet No; You will reveal it. Horatio Not I, my lord, by heaven. Marcellus Nor I, my lord. Hamlet How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? But you'll be secret?-- Horatio} } Ay, by heaven, my lord. Marcellus} Hamlet There's ne'er a villain, dwelling in all Denmark-- But he's an arrant knave.[118] Horatio There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this. Hamlet Why, right; you are in the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part: You as your business and desire shall point you, For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is;--and, for my own poor part, Look you, I will go pray. Horatio These are but wild and whirling words,[119] my lord. Hamlet I am sorry they offend you, heartily. Horatio There's no offence, my lord. Hamlet Yes, by Saint Patrick,[120] but there is, Horatio, And much offence, too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: For your desire to know what is between us, O'er-master it[121] as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request. Horatio What is't, my lord? We will. Hamlet Never make known what you have seen to-night. Horatio} } My lord, we will not. Marcellus} Hamlet Nay, but swear't. Horatio Propose the oath, my lord. Hamlet Never to speak of this that you have seen. Swear by my sword. [HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS _place each their right hand on_ HAMLET'S _sword._] Ghost (_Beneath._) Swear. Horatio O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! Hamlet And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.[122] There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;-- Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet To put an antick disposition[123] on,-- That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber'd thus,[124] or this head-shake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As, _Well, we know_; or, _We could, an if we would_; or, _If we list to speak_;--or, _There be, an if they might_;-- Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me:--This do you swear, So grace and mercy at your most need help you! [HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS _again place their hands on_ HAMLET'S _sword._] Ghost (_Beneath._) Swear. Hamlet Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, Heaven willing, shall not lack.[125] Let us go in together; [_Crosses to_ L.] And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint;--O curs\u00e8d spite, That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together. [_Exeunt_ L.H.] END OF ACT FIRST.",

        "SCENE I.--A ROOM IN POLONIUS'S HOUSE.": "_Enter_ POLONIUS[1] (L.H.), _meeting Ophelia._ (R.H.) Polonius How now, Ophelia! What's the matter? Ophelia O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! Polonius With what, in the name of Heaven? Ophelia My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport, He comes before me. Polonius Mad for thy love? Ophelia My lord, I do not know; But, truly, I do fear it. Polonius What said he? Ophelia He took me by the wrist, and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long staid he so; At last,--a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound, As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,[2] And end his being: That done, he lets me go: And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o'doors he went without their helps, And, to the last, bended their light on me. Polonius Come, go with me; I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstacy of love;[3] What, have you given him any hard words of late? Ophelia No, my good lord; but, as you did command, I did repel his letters, and denied His access to me. Polonius That hath made him mad. Come, go we to the king: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love.[4] Come. [_Exeunt_ L.H.]",
        "SCENE II.--A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.": "_Enter_ KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, _and_ Attendants (R.H.) King (C.) Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation. What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself,[5] I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, That you vouchsafe your rest[6] here in our court Some little time: so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, That, open'd, lies within our remedy. Queen (R.C.) Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you; And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you So to expend your time with us a while, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance. Rosencrantz (R.) Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,[7] Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty. _Guil._ (R.) But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,[8] To lay our service freely at your feet. King Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. Queen I do beseech you instantly to visit My too much chang\u00e8d son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. [_Exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, _and_ Attendants, R.H.] _Enter_ POLONIUS (L.H.) Polonius Now do I think (or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy[9] so sure As it hath us'd to do), that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy. King (C.) O, speak of that; that do I long to hear. Polonius (L.C.) My liege, and madam, to expostulate[10] What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time; Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,-- I will be brief:--Your noble son is mad: Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't, but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go. Queen (R.C.) More matter, with less art. Polonius Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis, 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or, rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause: Thus it remains, and the remainder thus, Perpend.[11] I have a daughter, have, while she is mine, Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: Now gather, and surmise. [Reads] _To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,--_[12] That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase, _beautified_ is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: _In her excellent white bosom,[13] these_, &c.[14] Queen Came this from Hamlet to her? Polonius Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.-- [_Reads._] _Doubt thou the stars are fire;_ _Doubt thou the sun doth move;_ _Doubt truth to be a liar;_ _But never doubt, I love._ _O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;[15] I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best,[16] believe it. Adieu._ _Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him_,[17] Hamlet. This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me: And more above,[18] hath his solicitings,[19] As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to my ear. King But how hath she Receiv'd his love? Polonius What do you think of me? King As of a man faithful and honourable. Polonius I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing (As I perceived it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me), what might you, Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, If I had play'd the desk or table book;[20] Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;[21] Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;[22] What might you think? No, I went round to work,[23] And my young mistress thus did I bespeak: _Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere; This must not be:_ and then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;[24] And he, repuls'd (a short tale to make), Fell into sadness; thence into a weakness; Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for. King Do you think 'tis this? Queen It may be, very likely. Polonius Hath there been such a time (I'd fain know that,) That I have positively said, _'tis so_, When it proved otherwise? King Not that I know. Polonius Take this from this, if it be otherwise: [_Pointing to his head and shoulder._] If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre. King How may we try it further? Polonius You know, sometimes he walks for hours together Here in the lobby. Queen So he does, indeed. Polonius At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: Mark the encounter: if he love her not, And be not from his reason fallen thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm, and carters. King We will try it. Queen But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading. Polonius Away, I do beseech you both, away: I'll board him presently.[25] [_Exeunt_ KING _and_ QUEEN, R.H.] _Enter_ HAMLET, _reading_ (L.C.) Polonius How does my good lord Hamlet? Hamlet (C.) Excellent well. Polonius (R.) Do you know me, my lord? Hamlet Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.[26] Polonius Not I, my lord. Hamlet Then I would you were so honest a man. Polonius Honest, my lord! Hamlet Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. Polonius That's very true, my lord. Hamlet For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,----Have you a daughter?[27] Polonius I have, my lord. Hamlet Let her not walk i'the sun: conception is a blessing; but as your daughter may conceive,--friend, look to't, look to't, look to't. [_Goes up stage._] Polonius (_Aside._) Still harping on my daughter:--yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. [_Crosses to_ L.] I'll speak to him again.--What do you read, my lord? Hamlet (C.) Words, words, words. Polonius (L.) What is the matter, my lord? Hamlet Between who? Polonius I mean, the matter that you read, my lord. Hamlet Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue[28] says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: All of which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall be as old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward. [_Crosses_, L.] Polonius (_Aside._) Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. Will you walk out of the air, my lord? Hamlet Into my grave? [_Crosses_ R.] Polonius (L.) Indeed, that is out o' the air.--How pregnant sometimes his replies[29] are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you. Hamlet (C.) You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withall, except my life, except my life, except my life. Polonius Fare you well, my lord. [_Exit_ POLONIUS, L.H.] Hamlet These tedious old fools! Polonius (_Without._) You go to seek the lord Hamlet; there he is. Rosencrantz Heaven save you, sir! _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN (L.H.) _Guil._ My honor'd lord!-- Rosencrantz My most dear lord!-- Hamlet My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? [_Crosses to_ ROSENCRANTZ.] Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? What news? Rosencrantz (L.) None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. Hamlet (C.) Then is dooms-day near: but your news is not true. In the beaten way of friendship,[30] what make you at Elsinore? Rosencrantz To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. Hamlet Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. _Guil._ (R.) What should we say, my lord? Hamlet Any thing--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you. Rosencrantz To what end, my lord? Hamlet That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, [_taking their hands_,] by the consonancy of our youth,[31] by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer[32] could charge you withal, be even[33] and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no? Rosencrantz What say you? [_To_ GUILDENSTERN.] Hamlet Nay, then, I have an eye of you.[34] [_Crosses_ R.] [_Aside._] --if you love me, hold not off. _Guil._ My lord, we were sent for. Hamlet (_Returning_ C.) I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.[35] I have of late (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a steril promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express[36] and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon[37] of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me,--nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so. Rosencrantz My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. Hamlet Why did you laugh, then, when I said, _Man delights not me?_ Rosencrantz To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment[38] the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way;[39] and hither are they coming, to offer you service. Hamlet He that plays the king shall be welcome, his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace;[40] and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.[41]--What players are they? Rosencrantz Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city. Hamlet How chances it, they travel?[42] their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed? Rosencrantz No, indeed, they are not. Hamlet It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark,[43] and those that would make mouths at him[44] while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.[45] There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. [_Flourish of trumpets without._] _Guil._ There are the players. Hamlet Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived. _Guil._ In what, my dear lord? Hamlet I am but mad north-north west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.[46] [_Crosses_ R.] Polonius (_Without_, L.H.) Well be with you, gentlemen! Hamlet (_Crosses_ C.) Hark you, Guildenstern;--and Rosencrantz: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts. Rosencrantz (R.) Haply he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child. Hamlet I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You say right, sir: o'Monday morning; 'twas then, indeed. _Enter_ POLONIUS (L.H.) Polonius My lord, I have news to tell you. Hamlet My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,---- Polonius The actors are come hither, my lord. Hamlet Buz, buz![47] Polonius Upon my honour,---- Hamlet Then came each actor on his ass.[48] Polonius The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastorical-comical, historical-pastoral, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.[49] For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.[50] Hamlet _O, Jephthah, judge of Israel_,--what a treasure hadst thou! Polonius What a treasure had he, my lord? Hamlet Why,--_One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well._ Polonius Still harping on my daughter. [_Aside._] Hamlet Am I not i'the right, old Jephthah? Polonius If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well. Hamlet Nay, that follows not. Polonius What follows, then, my lord? Hamlet Why, _As by lot, God wot_,[51] and then, you know, _It came to pass, As most like it was_,--The first row of the pious Chanson[52] will show you more; for look, my abridgment comes.[53] _Enter Four or Five_ Players (L.H.)--POLONIUS _crosses behind_ HAMLET _to_ R.H. You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: O, old friend! Why, thy face is valanced[54] since I saw thee last; Com'st thou to beard me[55] in Denmark?--What, my young lady and mistress. By-'r-lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.[56] You are welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers,[57] fly at anything we see: We'll have a speech straight: Come, give us a taste of your quality;[58] come, a passionate speech. _1st Play._ (L.H.) What speech, my lord? Hamlet I heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:[59] but it was an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.[60] One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas \u00c6neas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: If it live in your memory, begin at this line; let me see, let me see;-- _The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast_,--'tis not so: it begins with Pyrrhus: _The rugged Pyrrhus,--he, whose sable arms_, _Black as his purpose, did the night resemble_, _Old grandsire Priam seeks._ Polonius (R.) 'Fore Heaven, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion. Hamlet (C.) So proceed you. _1st Play._ (L.) _Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command: Unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword[61] The unnerved father falls. But, as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack[62] stand still, The bold wind speechless, and the orb below As hush as death; anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; So, after Pyrrhus' pause, A roused vengeance sets him new a work; And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.-- Out, out, thou fickle Fortune!_ Polonius (R.) This is too long. Hamlet It shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Say on;--come to Hecuba. _1st Play._ _But who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen_-- Hamlet The mobled queen?[63] Polonius That's good; mobled queen is good. _1st Play._ _Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames; A clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood; and, for a robe, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, 'Gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounced._ Polonius Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.--Prithee, no more. Hamlet (C.) 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--Good, my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. Polonius (R.) My lord, I will use them according to their desert. Hamlet Much better: Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in. [_Crosses to_ R.H.] Polonius Come, sirs. Hamlet Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. [_Exit_ POLONIUS _with some of the_ Players, L.H.] Old friend [_Crosses to_ C.] --My good friends [_To_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN.] I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore--can you play the murder of Gonzago? [_Exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN, R.H.] _1st Play._ Ay, my lord. Hamlet We'll have it to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would insert in't--could you not? _1st Play._ Ay, my lord. Hamlet Very well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not. [_Exit_ Player, L.H.] Now I am alone. O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous, that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit, That, from her working, all his visage wann'd;[64] Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit?[65] And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue[66] for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears, And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty, and appal the free; Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John a-dreams,[67] unpregnant of my cause,[68] And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made.[69] Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i'the throat, As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, Ha? Why, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall To make oppression bitter;[70] or, ere this, I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal: Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless[71] villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a scold, unpack my heart with words, And fall a cursing, like a very drab, A scullion! Fye upon't! fye! About, my brains![72] I have heard That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul, that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick:[73] if he do blench,[74] I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil: and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and, perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy (As he is very potent with such spirits), Abuses me to damn me: I'll have good grounds More relative than this:[75] The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

        "SCENE I.--A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.": "_Enter_ KING _and_ QUEEN, _from_ (R.H.) _centre._ King There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves: You must translate:[1] 'tis fit we understand them. How does Hamlet? Queen Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier: In his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries _A rat, a rat!_ And, in this brainish apprehension,[2] kills The unseen good old man. King O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there: Where is he gone? Queen To draw apart the body he hath kill'd. King The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch, But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed We must, with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern! _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN (L.H.) Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him: Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. [ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN _cross to_ R.] I pray you, haste in this. [_Exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN, R.H.] Go, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; And let them know, both what we mean to do, And what's untimely done. [_Exit_ QUEEN, R.C.] How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He's lov'd of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence.[3] _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ (R.) How now! what hath befallen? Rosencrantz Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, We cannot get from him. King But where is he? Rosencrantz Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. King Bring him before us. Rosencrantz Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord. _Enter_ HAMLET, GUILDENSTERN, _and_ Attendants (R.H.) King (C.) Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius? Hamlet (R.) At supper. King At supper? Where? Hamlet Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politick worms[4] are e'en at him. King Where's Polonius? Hamlet In Heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i'the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby. King Go seek him there. [_To_ GUILDENSTERN.] Hamlet He will stay till you come. [_Exit_ GUILDENSTERN, R.H.] King Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, Must send thee hence: Therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help,[5] For England. Hamlet For England! King Ay, Hamlet. Hamlet Good. King So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. Hamlet I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England!--Farewell, dear mother. King Thy loving father, Hamlet. Hamlet My mother: Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England. [_Exit_, R.H.] King Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard; Away! for everything is seal'd and done. [_Exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ Attendants, R.H.] And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught, Thou may'st not coldly set[6] Our sovereign process;[7] which imports at full, By letters conjuring to that effect,[8] The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For thou must cure me: 'Till I know 'tis done, Howe'er my haps,[9] my joys will ne'er begin. [_Exit_ KING, L.H.] _Enter_ QUEEN _and_ HORATIO (R. _centre._) Queen ----I will not speak with her. Horatio She is importunate; indeed, distract: 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds. Queen Let her come in. [_Exit_ HORATIO, R.C.] _Re-enter_ HORATIO, _with_ OPHELIA (R. _centre._) Ophelia Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark? Queen How now, Ophelia! Ophelia (C.) [_Singing._] _How should I your true love know_ _From another one?_ _By his cockle hat and staff_, _And his sandal shoon._[10] Queen (L.C.) Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song? Ophelia Say you? nay, pray you, mark. [_Sings._] _He is dead and gone, lady_, _He is dead and gone_; _At his head a grass-green turf_, _At his heels a stone._ _Enter the_ KING (L.H.) Queen Nay, but, Ophelia,---- Ophelia Pray you, mark. [_Sings._] _White his shroud as the mountain-snow_, _Larded all with sweet flowers_;[11] _Which bewept to the grave did go_ _With true-love showers._ King How do you, pretty lady? Ophelia Well, Heaven 'ield you![12] (_Crosses to the_ KING.) They say the owl was a baker's daughter.[13] We know what we are, but know not what we may be. King Conceit upon her father.[14] Ophelia Pray, you, let us have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: _To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day_, _All in the morning betime_, _And I, a maid at your window_, _To be your Valentine:_ King Pretty Ophelia! Ophelia Indeed, without an oath, I'll make an end on't: _Then up he rose, and don'd his clothes_, _And dupp'd[15] the chamber door_; _Let in the maid, that out a maid_ _Never departed more._ [_Crosses to_ R.H.] King (L.) How long hath she been thus? Ophelia (R.) I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'the cold ground. My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night. [_Exit_, R.C.] King Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. [_Exit_ HORATIO, _through centre_ R.] O! this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death. O, Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions! _Enter_ MARCELLUS (R. _centre._) King What is the matter? Marcellus Save yourself, my lord: The young Laertes, in a riotous head,[16] O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; They cry, _Choose we: Laertes shall be king!_ Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds, _Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!_ [_Noise within_, R.C.] _Enter_ LAERTES, _armed_; Danes _following_ (R. _centre._) Laertes Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without. _Dan._ No, let's come in. Laertes I pray you, give me leave. _Dan._ We will, we will. [_They retire without_, R.H.] Laertes O, thou vile king, Give me my father. _Queen_ (_Interposing._) Calmly, good Laertes. Laertes (R.) That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard; Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother.[17] King (L.) What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person: There's such divinity doth hedge a king,[18] That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. Let him go, Gertrude. [QUEEN _obeys._] Laertes Where is my father? King Dead. Queen But not by him. King Let him demand his fill. Laertes How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with: To hell, allegiance! To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence,[19] Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd Most throughly for my father. King Who shall stay you! Laertes My will, not all the world's:[20] And, for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little. King Good Laertes, That I am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensible in grief[21] for it, It shall as level to your judgment 'pear As day does to your eye. Horatio (_Without._) Oh, poor Ophelia! King Let her come in. _Enter_ OPHELIA (R.C.), _fantastically dressed with Straws and Flowers._ Laertes (_Goes up_ L.C.) O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life? Ophelia (R.C.) _They bore him barefac'd on the bier_; _And on his grave rain many a tear,--_ Fare you well, my dove! Laertes (_Coming down_ R.) Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus. Ophelia You must sing, _Down-a-down,[22] an you call him a-down-a._ O, how well the wheel becomes it![23] It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter. Laertes This nothing's more than matter. Ophelia There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;[24] pray you, love, remember: and there is pansies,[25] that's for thoughts. Laertes A document in madness; thoughts and remembrance fitted. Ophelia There's fennel for you, (_crosses to the_ KING _on_ L.H.) and columbines:[26] there's rue for you; (_turns to the_ QUEEN, _who is_ R.C.) and here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace o'Sundays:[27]--you may wear your rue with a difference.[28]--There's a daisy:[29]--I would give you some violets,[30] but they withered all when my father died:--They say he made a good end,---- _For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy--_[31] Laertes (R.) Thought and affliction,[32] passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness. Ophelia _And will he not come again?_ _And will he not come again?_ _No, no, he is dead_, _Gone to his death-bed_, _He never will come again._ _His beard was white as snow_, _All flaxen was his poll:_ _He is gone, he is gone_, _And we cast away moan:_ _Heaven 'a mercy on his soul!_ And of all christian souls, I pray Heaven. Heaven be wi' you. [_Exit_ OPHELIA, R.C., QUEEN _following._] Laertes Do you see this, O Heaven? King (L.C.) Laertes, I must commune with your grief,[33] Or you deny me right. Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content. Laertes (R.C.) Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure funeral,-- No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,[34] No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-- Cry to be heard,[35] as 'twere from heaven to earth, That I must call't in question. King So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall.[36] How now! what news? _Enter_ BERNARDO (R.H.C.) Bernardo (C.) Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: This to your majesty; this to the Queen. King From Hamlet! who brought them? Bernardo Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not. King Laertes, you shall hear them.-- Leave us. [_Exit_, L.H.C.] [Reads.] _High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.[37] To morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return._ HAMLET. What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? Laertes (R.) Know you the hand? King (L.) 'Tis Hamlet's character:[38] _Naked,--_ And in a postscript here, he says, _alone_. Can you advise me? Laertes I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come; It warms the very sickness in my heart, That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, _Thus diddest thou_. King If it be so, Laertes, Will you be rul'd by me? Laertes Ay, my lord; So you will not o'er-rule me to a peace. King To thine own peace. Some two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy, He made confession of[39] you; And gave you such a masterly report, For art and exercise in your defence,[40] And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy, That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with you. Now, out of this,---- Laertes What out of this, my lord? King Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart? Laertes Why ask you this? King Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine, together, And wager o'er your heads; he, being remiss,[41] Most generous, and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils:[42] so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated,[43] and, in a pass of practice,[44] Requite him for your father. Laertes I will do't: And, for the purpose, I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal, that but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm[45] so rare, Collected from all simples[46] that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death. King (L.) Let's further think of this; We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,[47] When in your motion[48] you are hot and dry, (As make your bouts more violent to that end,) And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce;[49] whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,[50] Our purpose may hold there. But stay, what noise? _Enter_ QUEEN (R.C.) Queen (C.) One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow: Your sister's drown'd, Laertes. Laertes (R.) Drown'd! O, where? Queen There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; Therewith fantastick garlands did she make Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples;[51] There, on the pendent boughs her cornet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke; When down her weedy trophies, and herself, Fell in the weeping brook. Laertes I forbid my tears: But yet It is our trick:[52] nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out.[53] Adieu, my lord: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly drowns it.[54] [_Exeunt._ C.] END OF ACT FOURTH.",

Polonius My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: Behind the arras I'll convey myself,[109] To hear the process;[110] I'll warrant, she'll tax him home: And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech of vantage.[111] Fare you well, my liege: [POLONIUS _crosses to_ L.H.] I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know. King Thanks, dear my lord. [_Exeunt_ POLONIUS, L.H., _and_ KING, R.H.]",
        "SCENE III.--THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER.": "_Enter_ QUEEN _and_ POLONIUS (L.H.) Polonius He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him:[112] Tell him his pranks have been too broad[113] to bear with, And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.[114] Pray you, be round with him. Queen I'll warrant you; Fear me not:--withdraw, I hear him coming. [POLONIUS _hides himself_, L.H.U.E. _Enter_ HAMLET (R.) Hamlet (R.C.) Now, mother, what's the matter? Queen (L.C.) Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. Hamlet Mother, you have my father much offended. Queen Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. Hamlet Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. Queen Why, how now, Hamlet! Hamlet What's the matter now? Queen Have you forgot me? Hamlet No, by the rood,[115] not so: You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; And--would it were not so!--you are my mother. Queen Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. Hamlet Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you. Queen What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho! Polonius (_Behind._) What, ho! help! Hamlet How now! a rat?[116] [_Draws._] Dead, for a ducat, dead! [HAMLET _rushes off behind the arras._] Polonius (_Behind._) O, I am slain! [_Falls and dies._] Queen O me, what hast thou done? Hamlet (_Returning._) Nay, I know not: Is it the king? Queen O, what a rash and bloody deed is this! Hamlet A bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother. Queen As kill a king! Hamlet Ay, lady, 'twas my word. [_Goes off behind the arras, and returns._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! [_To the dead body of_ POLONIUS, _behind the arras_.] I took thee for thy better. Leave wringing of your hands: Peace; sit you down, [_To the_ QUEEN.] And let me wring your heart: for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff; If damn\u00e8d custom have not brazed it so,[117] That it be proof and bulwark against sense.[118] Queen (_Sits_ R.C.) What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me? Hamlet (_Seated_ L.C.) Such an act, That blurs the grace and blush of modesty; Calls virtue, hypocrite; takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love, And sets a blister there;[119] makes marriage vows As false as dicer's oaths: O, such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul;[120] and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words.-- Ah, me, that act! Queen Ah me, what act? Hamlet Look here, upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment[121] of two brothers. See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyp\u00e9rion's curls;[122] the front of Jove himself; An eye like Mars, to threaten and command; A station like the herald Mercury[123] New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; A combination, and a form, indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man; This was your husband.--Look you now, what follows: Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother.[124] Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor?[125] Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love; for, at your age The hey-day in the blood[126] is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgment: And what judgment Would step from this to this? O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine,[127] in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire. Queen O, Hamlet, speak no more: Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; And there I see such black and grain\u00e8d spots As will not leave their tinct.[128] Hamlet Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,----[129] Queen O, speak to me no more; No more, sweet Hamlet! Hamlet A murderer and a villain: A slave that is not twentieth part the tythe Of your precedent lord;--a vice of kings;[130] A cutpurse of the empire and the rule; That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket![131] Queen No more! Hamlet A king Of shreds and patches.[132] [_Enter_ Ghost, R.] Save me [_Starts from his chair_], and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? Queen Alas, he's mad! [_Rising._] Hamlet (L.) Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, laps'd in time and passion,[133] lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O, say! Ghost (R.) Do not forget: This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: O, step between her and her fighting soul. Speak to her Hamlet. Hamlet How is it with you, lady? Queen Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy, And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep. O gentle son, [_Crosses to_ HAMLET.] Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience.[134] Whereon do you look? Hamlet On him, on him!--Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, Would make them capable.[135] Do not look upon me; Lest with this piteous action, you convert My stern effects:[136] then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance, for blood. Queen To whom do you speak this? Hamlet Do you see nothing there? Queen Nothing at all; yet all that is, I see.[137] Hamlet Nor did you nothing hear? Queen No, nothing but ourselves. Hamlet Why, look you there! look, how it steals away! [_Ghost crosses to_ L.] My father in his habit as he lived![138] Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! [_Exit_ Ghost, L.H. HAMLET _sinks into chair_ C. _The_ QUEEN _falls on her knees by his side._] Queen This is the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.[139] Hamlet Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music: It is not madness That I have uttered: bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from.[140] Mother, for love of grace, _Rising._] Lay not that flattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass, but my madness speaks: It will but skin and film[141] the ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come. Queen O, Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain. Hamlet O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed; [_Raising the_ QUEEN.] Assume a virtue, if you have it not. Once more, good night! And when you are desirous to be bless'd, I'll blessing beg of you.[142] For this same lord, [_Pointing to_ POLONIUS.] I do repent: I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night. [_Exit_ QUEEN, R.H.] I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. [_Exit_ HAMLET _behind the arras_, L.H.U.E. END OF ACT THIRD.",
        "SCENE I.--A CHURCH YARD.": "_Enter two_ Clowns,[1] _with spades, &c._ (L.H.U.E.) _1st Clo._ (R.) Is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation? _2nd Clo._ (L.) I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight:[2] the crowner[3] hath set on her, and finds it christian burial. _1st Clo._ How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence? _2nd Clo._ Why, 'tis found so. _1st Clo._ It must be _se offendendo_;[4] it cannot be else. For here lies the point: If I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform:[5] argal,[6] she drowned herself wittingly. _2nd Clo._ Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.[7] _1st Clo._ Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: If the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,[8] mark you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. _2nd Clo._ But is this law? _1st Clo._ Ay, marry is't; crowner's-quest law.[9] _2nd Clo._ Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of christian burial. _1st Clo._ Why, there thou say'st:[10] And the more pity that great folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian.[11] Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession. _2nd Clo._ Was he a gentleman?[12] _1st Clo._ He was the first that ever bore arms. I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself----[13] _2nd Clo._ Go to. _1st Clo._ What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? _2nd Clo._ The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. _1st Clo._ I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; But how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come. _2nd Clo._ Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter? _1st Clo._ Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.[14] _2nd Clo._ Marry, now I can tell. _1st Clo._ To't. _2nd Clo._ Mass, I cannot tell. _1st Clo._ Cudgel thy brains no more about it,[15] for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, a grave-maker, the houses that he makes, last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan, and fetch me a stoup of liquor.[16] [_Exit_ 2nd Clown, L.H.U.E.] _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO (L.H.U.E.) First Clown _digs and sings._ _In youth, when I did love, did love_,[17] _Methought, it was very sweet_, _To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove_ _O, methought, there was nothing meet._ Hamlet (_Behind the grave._) Has this fellow no feeling of his business, he sings at grave-making? Horatio (_On_ HAMLET'S R.) Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. Hamlet 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.[18] _1st Clo._ _But age, with his stealing steps_, _Hath clawed me in his clutch_, _And hath shipped me into the land_, _As if I had never been such._ [_Throws up a skull._] Hamlet That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent Heaven, might it not? Horatio It might, my lord. [_Gravedigger throws up bones._] Hamlet Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with them?[19] mine ache to think on't. _1st Clo._ [_Sings._] _A pick-axe and a spade, a spade_, _For and a shrouding sheet:_[20] _O, a pit of clay for to be made_ _For such a guest is meet._ [_Throws up a skull._ Hamlet There's another: Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets,[21] his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce[22] with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? I will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sirrah? _1st Clo._ Mine, sir.-- [_Sings._] _O, a pit of clay for to be made_ _For such a guest is meet._ Hamlet (R. _of grave._) I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't. _1st Clo._ You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine. Hamlet Thou dost lie in't, to be in't, and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. _1st. Clo._ 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you. Hamlet What man dost thou dig it for? _1st Clo._ For no man, sir. Hamlet What woman, then? _1st Clo._ For none, neither. Hamlet Who is to be buried in't? _1st Clo._ One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead. Hamlet How absolute the knave is![23] we must speak by the card,[24] or equivocation will undo us, [_To_ HORATIO, R.] How long hast thou been a grave-maker? _1st Clo._ Of all the days i'the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. Hamlet How long's that since? _1st Clo._ Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,[25] he that is mad, and sent into England. Hamlet Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? _1st Clo._ Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there. Hamlet Why? _1st Clo._ 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he. Hamlet How came he mad? _1st Clo._ Very strangely, they say. Hamlet How strangely? _1st Clo._ 'Faith, e'en with losing his wits. Hamlet Upon what ground? _1st Clo._ Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years. Hamlet How long will a man lie i'the earth ere he rot? _1st Clo._ 'Faith, if he be not rotten before he die, he will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year. Hamlet Why he more than another? _1st Clo._ Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your ill-begotten dead body. Here's a skull now, hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years. Hamlet Whose was it? _1st Clo._ O, a mad fellow's it was: Whose do you think it was? Hamlet Nay, I know not. _1st Clo._ A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! he poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester. Hamlet This? [_Takes the skull._] _1st Clo._ E'en that. Hamlet Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour[26] she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing. Horatio What's that, my lord? Hamlet Dost thou think Alexander look'd o'this fashion i'the earth? Horatio E'en so. Hamlet And smelt so? pah! [_Gives the skull to HORATIO, who returns it to the grave-digger._] Horatio E'en so, my lord. Hamlet To what base uses may we return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till it find it stopping a bung-hole? Horatio 'Twere to consider too curiously,[27] to consider so. Hamlet No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: As thus; Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; And why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel? Imperial C\u00e6sar,[28] dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away: O, that the earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw![29] But soft! but soft! aside: Here comes the king, The queen, the courtiers: Who is this they follow? And with such maim\u00e8d rites?[30] This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life:[31] 'Twas of some estate.[32] Couch we awhile, and mark. [_Retiring with_ HORATIO, R.H.] _Enter_ Priests, &c., _in procession; the corpse of_ OPHELIA, LAERTES _and_ Mourners _following_; KING, QUEEN, _their_ Trains, _&c._ Laertes (L. _of the grave._) What ceremony else? Hamlet (R.) That is Laertes, A very noble youth. _1st Priest._ (R. _of the grave._) Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd As we have warranty: Her death was doubtful; And, but that great command o'ersways the order,[33] She should in ground unsanctified have lodged Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers, Shards,[34] flints, and pebbles, should be thrown on her: Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,[35] Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.[36] Laertes Must there no more be done? _1st Priest._ No more be done: We should profane the service of the dead To sing a _requiem_,[37] and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls. Laertes O, from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,[38] A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling. Hamlet What, the fair Ophelia! Queen (_Behind the grave_, C. _with the_ KING.) Sweets to the sweet: Farewell! [_Scattering flowers._] I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, And not have strew'd thy grave. Laertes O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense[39] Depriv'd thee of!--Hold off the earth a while, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms: [_Leaps into the grave._] Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o'ertop old Pelion,[40] or the skyish head Of blue Olympus. Hamlet (_Advancing._) What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?--whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers?--this is I, Hamlet the Dane. Laertes (L., _leaping from the grave._) The devil take thy soul! [_Grappling with him._] Hamlet (R.C.) Thou pray'st not well. I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though I am not splenetive and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear: Hold off thy hand! King Pluck them asunder. Queen (C.) Hamlet, Hamlet! Hamlet (R.C.) Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag. Queen O my son, what theme? Hamlet I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.--What wilt thou do for her? Queen O, he is mad, Laertes. Hamlet Come, show me what thou'lt do: Wou'lt weep? wou'lt fight? wou'lt fast? wou'lt tear thyself? I'll do't.--Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me[41] with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I: And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground,[42] Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa[43] like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou. Queen This is mere madness: And thus a while the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,[44] His silence will sit drooping. Hamlet Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I lov'd you ever: But it is no matter; Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew,[45] and dog will have his day. [_Exit_, R.H.] King (C.) I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. [_Exit_ HORATIO, R.H.] Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son, [_Exit_ QUEEN, _attended_, R.H.] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;[46] [_To_ LAERTES.] We'll put the matter to the present push.-- This grave shall have a living monument:[47] An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. [_The characters group round the grave._]",
        "SCENE II.--HALL IN THE CASTLE.": "_Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO (R.H.) Hamlet But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For by the image of my cause,[48] I see The portraiture of his. Horatio Peace! who comes here? _Enter_ OSRIC (L.H.) Osric Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. Hamlet (C.) I humbly thank you, sir.--Dost know this water-fly?[49] Horatio (R.) No, my good lord. Hamlet Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. Osric (L.) Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty. Hamlet I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.[50] Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. Osric I thank your lordship, 'tis very hot. Hamlet No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly. Osric It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. Hamlet But yet, methinks it is very sultry and hot,[51] for my complexion,-- Osric Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere,--I cannot tell how.--But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you, that he has laid a great wager on your head: Sir, this is the matter,-- Hamlet I beseech you, remember---- [HAMLET _moves him to put on his hat._] Osric Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.[52] Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing:[53] Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,[54] he is the card or calendar of gentry,[55] for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.[56] Hamlet What imports the nomination of this gentleman?[57] Osric Of Laertes? Hamlet Of him, sir. Osric Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-- Hamlet I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.[58] Osric I mean, sir, for his weapon. Hamlet What is his weapon? Osric Rapier and dagger. Hamlet That's two of his weapons: but, well. Osric The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed,[59] as I take it, six French rapiers and poignards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,[60] or so: Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.[61] Hamlet What call you the carriages? Osric The carriages, sir, are the hangers. Hamlet The phrase would be more german[62] to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides. Osric The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.[63] Hamlet How if I answer no?[64] Osric I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. Hamlet Sir, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. Osric Shall I deliver you so? Hamlet To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. Osric I commend my duty to your lordship. [_Exit_, L.H.] Horatio (R.) You will lose this wager, my lord. Hamlet (C.) I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.[65] But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter. Horatio Nay, good my lord. Hamlet It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,[66] as would, perhaps, trouble a woman. Horatio If your mind dislike any thing, obey it:[67] I will forestall their repair hither, and say, you are not fit. Hamlet Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. [_Exeunt_, L.H.]",
        "SCENE III.--ROOM IN THE CASTLE.": "KING _and_ QUEEN, _on a dais_, LAERTES (R.), LORDS (R.), LADIES (L.), OSRIC (R.) _and_ Attendants, _with Foils, &c., discovered_ (R.H.); _Tables_ (R. _and_ L.)-- _Flourish of Trumpets._ _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO (L.H.) King Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. Hamlet (_offering his hand to_ LAERTES) Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong; But pardon it, as you are a gentleman. Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot my arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother. Laertes (R.) I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge. I do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it. Hamlet I embrace it freely: And will this brother's wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Laertes Come, one for me. Hamlet I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i'the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.[68] Laertes You mock me, sir. Hamlet No, by this hand. King Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager? Hamlet Very well, my lord; Your grace hath laid the odds o'the weaker side. King I do not fear it; I have seen you both: But since he's better'd,[69] we have therefore odds. Laertes This is too heavy, let me see another. Hamlet This likes me well. These foils have all a length? Osric Ay, my good lord. King Set me the stoups of wine[70] upon that table.-- [Pages _exeunt_ R. _and_ L.] If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit[71] in answer to the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw,[72] Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn. [Pages _return with wine._] Give me the cup; And let the kettle[73] to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth, _Now the king drinks to Hamlet._--Come, begin; And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. Hamlet Come on, sir. Laertes Come, my lord. [_They play._] Hamlet One. Laertes No. Hamlet Judgment. Osric A hit, a very palpable hit. Laertes Well:--again. King Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; [_Drops poison into the goblet._] Here's to thy health. [_Pretends to drink._] [_Trumpets sound; and cannon shot off within._] Give him the cup. Hamlet I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. [Page _places the goblet on table_, L.] Come. Another hit; What say you? [_They play._] Laertes A touch, a touch, I do confess. King Our son shall win. Queen The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.[74] Hamlet Good madam!---- [_Trumpets sound._] King Gertrude, do not drink. Queen I have, my lord; I pray you, pardon me. King It is the poison'd cup; it is too late. [_Aside._] Laertes I'll hit him now And yet it is almost against my conscience. [_Aside._] Hamlet Come, for the third, Laertes: You do but dally; I pray you, pass with your best violence; I am afeard you make a wanton of me.[75] Laertes Say you so? come on. [_They play._] [LAERTES _wounds_ HAMLET; _then, in scuffling they change Rapiers, and_ HAMLET _wounds_ LAERTES.] King Part them; they are incensed. Hamlet Nay, come, again. [_The_ QUEEN _falls back in her chair._] Osric (_Supporting_ LAERTES, R.) Look to the queen there, ho! Horatio (_Supporting_ HAMLET, L.) How is it, my lord? Osric How is't, Laertes? Laertes Why, as a woodcock to my own springe,[76] Osric; I am justly killed with mine own treachery. Hamlet How does the queen? King She swoons to see them bleed. Queen No, no, the drink, the drink,--O, my dear Hamlet,-- The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. [_The_ QUEEN _is conveyed off the stage by her attendant_ Ladies, _in a dying state_, L.H.U.E.] Hamlet O villainy! Ho! let the doors be lock'd: Treachery! seek it out. [LAERTES _falls._] Laertes (R.) It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good, In thee there is not half an hour's life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom'd:[77] the foul practice[78] Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie, Never to rise again: Thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame. Hamlet The point Envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damn\u00e8d Dane, Follow my mother. [_Stabs the_ KING, _who is borne away by his attendants, mortally wounded_, R.H.U.E.] Laertes He is justly serv'd; Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me! [_Dies._] Hamlet (C.) Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, death,[79] Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you,-- But let it be. Horatio, Report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied. Horatio (L.) Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left. [_Seizing the goblet on table_, L.] Hamlet As thou'rt a man,-- Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have it. [_Dashes the goblet away._] O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me![80] If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Abs\u00e8nt thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story.-- O, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit;[81] The rest is silence. [_Dies_, C., OSRIC _on his_ R., _and_ HORATIO _on his_ L.] _Dead March afar off._ _Curtain slowly descends._ THE END."
